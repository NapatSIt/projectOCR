These rules indicate the likelihood of the co-occurrence of items in transactions or events.,
"A basic form of an association rule is expressed as ""if X then Y,"" where X and Y are sets of items.",
"The ""if"" part (antecedent) represents the conditions or items present in the data, while the ""then"" part (consequent) denotes the items that tend to co-occur with the antecedent.",
"Association rules are measured by support, confidence, and lift.",
Support indicates the frequency of occurrence of a rule in the dataset.,
Confidence measures how often the rule is found to be true.,
"Lift quantifies the degree of dependency between the antecedent and consequent of a rule, indicating how much better the rule predicts the consequent compared to random chance.",
Association rule mining involves finding rules that satisfy predefined support and confidence thresholds.,

Confidence is calculated as the proportion of transactions containing the antecedent that also contain the consequent.,
Lift is computed as the ratio of the observed support to the expected support under independence assumptions.,
"A lift greater than 1 indicates that the antecedent and consequent occur together more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting a positive association.",
"A lift less than 1 implies that the antecedent and consequent occur together less frequently than expected, indicating a negative association.",
"Association rules with high support, confidence, and lift are considered strong rules and are of particular interest in many applications.",
"However, high support alone does not necessarily imply a useful association, as it may capture common occurrences that are not informative.",
